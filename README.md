# Digital-Clock-with-Java

This digital clock application provides a real-time display of the current date and time through a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI). Utilizing labels, the clock automatically updates to show the time in HH:MM:SS (hours, minutes, seconds) format and the date in EEE, MMM dd, yyyy (day, month, day, year) format. Built with the Java Swing library, known for its versatile components, the application leverages elements such as JLabel and JPanel. The `setText()` method is used to display the date and time on the JLabel components. The application uses the `Calendar` class from the `java.util` package to obtain the current date and time.

`getTime()` method: Part of the `Calendar` class in the `java.util` package, this method retrieves the current system date and time in a specified format.
